# [2.0.0](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/feature-hub/compare/v1.7.0...v2.0.0) (2019-06-20)


### Features

* **core:** remove ability to provide configs via FeatureServiceRegistry ([#500](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/feature-hub/issues/500)) ([388b9f0](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/feature-hub/commit/388b9f0))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** The option `featureServiceConfigs` has been removed
from the options of `createFeatureHub` and from the options of the
`FeatureServiceRegistry` constructor. The `env` that is passed to a
Feature Service's `create` method does not include a `config` property
anymore. If a Feature Service must be configured, a factory function
that accepts options, and that returns a Feature Service definition,
should be used instead, see `@feature-hub/async-ssr-manager` for an
example.
